Qt Ultralight Browser
=====================

This is an ultra-lightweight web browser powered by the [Ultralight](https://ultralig.ht/) web engine embedded in [Qt 5](https://www.qt.io/) app as a custom webview widget - **QUltralight (Qt Ultralight)** - a lightweight replacement for Qt WebKit. The project is at very early stage, so it may be unstable.

Qt Ultralight Browser is very lightweight, it uses only 68 MB of RAM after loading the homepage (DuckDuckGo) and it provides GPU rendering on supported hardware:
